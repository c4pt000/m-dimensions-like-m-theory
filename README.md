my interdimensional theories and partial theories of parallel timelines that exist inside of singular big bang events

but big bang events are parallel universes

we exist as Human beings in a 4th dimensional reality as 3 dimensional organisms 

LxWxH for 3 dimensions 

time is also a dimension not a concept

movement in 3 dimensions is measured in inches, feet, yards as distance

movement of the 4th dimension is also a form of movement but not measured in distance and not visually recoginzable as movement 

(BUT THINGS ARE MOVING THROUGH TIME IN THE 4TH DIMENSIONSAL EXTENSION OF OUR 3 DIMENSIONS BUT NOT IN TERMS OF LENGTH OF DISANCE OF INCHES, OR FEET OR YARDS)

as it is always continually moving forward at a constant rate for the last 14.5 billion years since the beginning of this known universe-and-timeline of events of every known area of the known universe

the universe is mostly 5 dimensions starting from a 4th dimensional timeline from OUR big bang of the beginning of our known universe being the starting point of our timeline not only for earth 4.5 billion years ago but the starting point of a 4th dimensional timeline of every known previous object that is or isnt still existent in our known universe
where everything we perceive including ourselves are existent in 3 dimensions of physical realm and beyond

traveling between different parallel universes would require exiting from 4th dimensional timespace into higher order 5th dimensional space (where time can be traversed to a different forward or backwards temporal event)
diagramh

but the problem with entering the 5th dimension to travel to a different day and time in our known 4th dimension of our version of earth as we know it from our origin of leaving the 4th dimension to enter into the realm of the 5th dimension

traveling back either forward or backwards to our timeline would be 1000x more confusing to find the right point of where we would like to be slightly forward in time or slightly backward from the point of orign of time when we left

(to advance into the future or the past)

the problem is entering the 5th dimension and trying to go back to the same point of our known timeline where we left from would be so confusing to pinpoint

because entering the 5th dimension the 4th dimension branches into n-th amount of parallel 4th dimenional possiblites of different would be events that took place or didnt take place as a confusing almost seemly infinite (but not actually infinite set of events)

imagine this.... we exit the 4th dimension to and enter the 5th dimension in order to travel forward or backwards at future or previous datetime

it would appear like each 4th dimensional possibility to re enter into would look like time lapse streaks and blurbs of events

if we exited out of the 5th dimension and entered into the 6th dimension to travel parallel universes that take place along side of our own known universe (where each universe has a big bang starting point the size of a 1cm^ infinitely dense and massive event)


trying to travel back to our 5th dimensional universe inside of the higher ordinal 6th dimension

every possible parllel universe would appear like a speck of light where each speck of light is actually a 5th dimensional construct 
with many many 4th dimensional possiblities inside of our universe existing inside of it)

our universe as we know it 5th dimensional with many braches of 4th dimensional possiblites 
to travel through many 4th dimensional possiblities to get back to our timeline of our known 4th dimensional time space the way we experience reality now all of our lives


think of it like this with modern space travel
when traveling 4th dimensions through space with a rocket and traveling 10 light years or really really far into space
imagine the depths of space and every single surrounding star in the depths of space............. which one............ is our star to get back to .....to get back to earth that we left from as our orign 
because every tiny speck of distant star light of trillions of stars all look and appear the same


the density of exiting into the 6th dimension WOULD BE MORE DENSE THAN WHEN THE UNIVERSE WAS 13E48 th of a pico second old at the very instance

when the big bang event of matter was almost infinitely dense and massive when the universe was the size of 1/100000000000 of a match head


the 6th dimension is even more dense and massive than that

and every pin prick of energy inside of the 6th dimension (which is every possible starting point of every possible alternative universe looks like specks of light like stars...

but would appear like they are blinking on and off (to either exist or not exist as quantum states) and moving like they either did exist or never existed and expanded into long 5th dimensional constructs containg many many multiple 4th dimensional timespace of stars and planets unique to each one

the stars in the night sky are fixed and dont appear to be visually moving (even though some of them are non-existant due to the speed of light of traveling millions of years just to be visible AS WE PERCEIVE THE STARS WHERE SOME OF THE STARS A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THEM SHINE LIGHT IN OUR NIGHT SKY BUT 0.000001 are not even physically remotely there anymore but viewing from here on earth it seems like its a physically visible star)


our universe started as the big bang 14.5 billion years ago our Star for earth formed 4.5 billion years ago and some random guess is that all of known matter anywhere in the known universe at the end of the universe's final expansion....... trillions of years from now gets recollected and compressed back into the size of tiny of speck of infinitely dense and infinitely massive object to expand again into the a slighy different universe out of many many many possible parallel universes existing as specks of light and energy inside of the construct of the 6th dimension 




current grand cosmologists theorize that the known universe that we exist inside of with earth that the entire known universe beyond all known galaxies is shaped like a hyper torus (a repeating tublar shape

think of a gigantic tube like a tube inside of a 10 speed bicycle tire but with a tight pinch on the tube the size of a pinhead which represents the starting point of the big bang when it was the size of a pin head  
and the universe expands from the big bang and after trillions of years when ALL KNOWN FORMS OF MATTER DECAY AND FIZZLE OUT AND BREAK DOWN INTO THE VACUUM OF THE STARTING POINT OF THE HYPER TORUS TO RE EXAPND AGAIN AS AN INFINITE STARTING LOOP OF 5 DIMENSIONAL SPACE CONTAINING MANY MANY MANY 4TH DIMENSIONAL CONSTRUCTS INSIDE OF 1 5TH DIMENSIONAL SPACE OF OUR KNOWN UNIVERSE)

dont laugh
