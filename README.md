my interdimensional theories and partial theories of parallel timelines that exist inside of singular big bang events but big bang events are parallel universes

we exist as Human beings in a 4th dimensional reality as 3 dimensional organisms

LxWxH for 3 dimensions

time is also a dimension not a concept

movement in 3 dimensions is measured in inches, feet, yards as distance

movement of the 4th dimension is also a form of movement but not measured in distance and not visually recognizable as movement

(BUT THINGS ARE MOVING THROUGH TIME IN THE 4TH DIMENSIONAL EXTENSION OF OUR 3 DIMENSIONS BUT NOT IN TERMS OF LENGTH OF DISTANCE OF INCHES, OR FEET OR YARDS)

as it is always continually moving forward at a constant rate for the last 14.5 billion years since the beginning of this known universe-and-timeline of events of every known area of the known universe

the universe is mostly many many many many different versions of parallel 5th dimensional construct starting from a 4th dimensional timeline from OUR big bang of the beginning of our known universe being the starting point of our timeline not only for earth 4.5 billion years ago but the starting point of a 4th dimensional timeline of every known previous object that is or isnt still existent in our known universe where everything we perceive including ourselves are existent in 3 dimensions of physical realm and beyond

traveling between different parallel universes would require exiting from 4th dimensional timespace into higher order 5th dimensional space (where time can be traversed to a different forward or backwards temporal event) diagram

but the problem with entering the 5th dimension to travel to a different day and time in our known 4th dimension of our version of earth as we know it from our origin of leaving the 4th dimension to enter into the realm of the 5th dimension

traveling back either forward or backwards to our timeline would be 1000x more confusing to find the right point of where we would like to be slightly forward in time or slightly backward from the point of origin of time when we left

(to advance into the future or the past)

the problem is entering the 5th dimension and trying to go back to the same point of our known timeline where we left from would be so confusing to pinpoint

because entering the 5th dimension the 4th dimension branches into n-th amount of parallel 4th dimensional possibilities of different would be events that took place or didn't take place as a confusing almost seemly infinite (but not actually infinite set of events)

imagine this.... we exit the 4th dimension to and enter the 5th dimension in order to travel forward or backwards at future or previous datetime

it would appear like each 4th dimensional possibility to re enter into would look like time lapse streaks and blurbs of events

if we exited out of the 5th dimension and entered into the 6th dimension to travel parallel universes that take place along side of our own known universe (where each universe has a big bang starting point the size of a 1cm^ infinitely dense and massive event)

trying to travel back to our 5th dimensional universe inside of the higher ordinal 6th dimension

every possible parallel universe would appear like a speck of light where each speck of light is actually a 5th dimensional construct with many many 4th dimensional possibilities inside of our universe existing inside of it)

our universe as we know it 5th dimensional with many braches of 4th dimensional possibilities to travel through many 4th dimensional possibilities to get back to our timeline of our known 4th dimensional time space the way we experience reality now all of our lives

think of it like this with modern space travel when traveling 4th dimensions through space with a rocket and traveling 10 light years or really really far into space imagine the depths of space and every single surrounding star in the depths of space............. which one............ is our star to get back to .....to get back to earth that we left from as our origin because every tiny speck of distant star light of trillions of stars all look and appear the same

the density of exiting into the 6th dimension WOULD BE MORE DENSE THAN WHEN THE UNIVERSE WAS 13E48 th of a pico second old at the very instance

when the big bang event of matter was almost infinitely dense and massive when the universe was the size of 1/100000000000 of a match head

the 6th dimension is even more dense and massive than that

and every pin prick of energy inside of the 6th dimension (which is every possible starting point of every possible alternative universe looks like specks of light like stars...

but would appear like they are blinking on and off (to either exist or not exist as quantum states) and moving like they either did exist or never existed and expanded into long 5th dimensional constructs containing many many multiple 4th dimensional timespace of stars and planets unique to each one

the stars in the night sky are fixed and don't appear to be visually moving (even though some of them are non-existent due to the speed of light of traveling millions of years just to be visible AS WE PERCEIVE THE STARS WHERE SOME OF THE STARS A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THEM SHINE LIGHT IN OUR NIGHT SKY BUT 0.000001 are not even physically remotely there anymore but viewing from here on earth it seems like its a physically visible star)

our universe started as the big bang 14.5 billion years ago our Star for earth formed 4.5 billion years ago and some random guess is that all of known matter anywhere in the known universe at the end of the universe's final expansion....... trillions of years from now gets recollected and compressed back into the size of tiny of speck of infinitely dense and infinitely massive object to expand again into the a slightly different universe out of many many many possible parallel universes existing as specks of light and energy inside of the construct of the 6th dimension

current grand cosmologists theorize that the known universe that we exist inside of with earth that the entire known universe beyond all known galaxies is shaped like a hyper torus (a repeating tubular shape

think of a gigantic tube like a tube inside of a 10 speed bicycle tire but with a tight pinch on the tube the size of a pinhead which represents the starting point of the big bang when it was the size of a pin head
and the universe expands from the big bang and after trillions of years when ALL KNOWN FORMS OF MATTER DECAY AND FIZZLE OUT AND BREAK DOWN INTO THE VACUUM OF THE STARTING POINT OF THE HYPER TORUS TO RE EXPAND AGAIN AS AN INFINITE STARTING LOOP EVERY TIME IT ENDS AND GETS COLLECTED AND COMPRESSED BACK TO MAKE A REPEATING BIG BANG EVENT OF THE EXPANSION OF A PARTICULAR UNIVERSE FORMING WHICH WAS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT THAN THE LAST TIME IT EXPANDED FOR A DURATION OF TRILLIONS OF YEARS WHICH CONTAINS 5 DIMENSIONAL SPACE CONTAINING MANY MANY MANY 4TH DIMENSIONAL CONSTRUCTS INSIDE OF 1 5TH DIMENSIONAL SPACE OF OUR KNOWN UNIVERSE)

SO IN 6th dimensional space there are many many big bang specks and each big bang speck of energy is one of many parallel universes each individual universe is comprised of its own 5th dimensional construct and inside of the 5th dimensional construct is many many many parallel 4th dimensional constructs

our reality that we know day to day slowing moving about our business and day to day personal lives and other things we do day to day

we are living in a 4th dimensional construct of time being a dimension and space being 3 dimensions

our reality is a 4th dimensional construct

our universe is a 5th dimensional construct which contains many many many many 4th dimensional constructs of parallel temporal space almost as many different versions AS TOO MANY 1000^100 beyond a gololplex^100 ALOT I DONT KNOW PERSONALLY BUT ALOT

our 4th dimensional view of reality and every known fixed star with its fixed orbiting planets are part of our 4th dimensional construct of day to day life

our 4th dimensional reality is part of our same local group of stars including our Sun in the sky 8 light minutes away part of our same 4th dimensional construct and andromeda galaxy 100 billion light years away the same 4th dimensional construct that we exist in is also part of our 4th dimensional construct as we exist in reality and go through day to day life one day at a time as human organisms

ee.

but our universe contains many many many many unique and different 4th dimensional constructs that have unique patterns of 4th dimensional constructs of everything in with the way that each one of those formed stars and planets but vastly different in how the expansion might or might not form certain stars or planets in the way we know our configuration of this 4th dimensional construct because each 4th dimensional construct of many of them form differently from the energy event where the 4th dimensional construct begins (time and matter expansion for billions of years)

our big bang is one of many 4th dimensional constructs that form inside of our known 5th dimensional universe

to travel to another universe outside of this universe it would require staying fixed in one spot in time and space without traveling anywhere at all and exiting into the 5th dimension then into the 6th dimension

more than one universe "parallel universes"

where each object in 6th dimensional space is a blinking micro pin head of an expanding alternative parallel universe as a string of many configurations 5th dimensional space containing many 4th dimensional possibilities as a construct with many many many 4th dimensional vectors

so the way the big bang formed and moved around and formed our star and earth 4.5 billion years ago

is not the way other almost infinitely seem lying never
