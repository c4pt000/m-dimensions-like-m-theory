we exist as Human beings in a 4th dimensional reality as 3 dimensional organisms 

LxWxH for 3 dimensions 

time is also a dimension not a concept

movement in 3 dimensions is measured in inches, feet, yards as distance

movement of the 4th dimension is also a form of movement but not measured in distance and not visually recoginzable as movement 

(BUT THINGS ARE MOVING THROUGH TIME IN THE 4TH DIMENSIONSAL EXTENSION OF OUR 3 DIMENSIONS BUT NOT IN TERMS OF LENGTH OF DISANCE OF INCHES, OR FEET OR YARDS)

as it is always continually moving forward at a constant rate for the last 14.5 billion years since the beginning of this known universe-and-timeline of events of every known area of the known universe

the universe is mostly 5 dimensions starting from a 4th dimensional timeline from OUR big bang of the beginning of our known universe being the starting point of our timeline not only for earth 4.5 billion years ago but the starting point of a 4th dimensional timeline of every known previous object that is or isnt still existent in our known universe
where everything we perceive including ourselves are existent in 3 dimensions of physical realm and beyond

traveling between different parallel universes would require exiting from 4th dimensional timespace into higher order 5th dimensional space (where time can be traversed to a different forward or backwards temporal event)
diagramh

but the problem with entering the 5th dimension to travel to a different day and time in our known 4th dimension of our version of earth as we know it from our origin of leaving the 4th dimension to enter into the realm of the 5th dimension

traveling back either forward or backwards to our timeline would be 1000x more confusing to find the right point of where we would like to be slightly forward in time or slightly backward from the point of orign of time when we left

(to advance into the future or the past)

the problem is entering the 5th dimension and trying to go back to the same point of our known timeline where we left from would be so confusing to pinpoint

because entering the 5th dimension the 4th dimension branches into n-th amount of parallel 4th dimenional possiblites of different would be events that took place or didnt take place as a confusing almost seemly infinite (but not actually infinite set of events)

imagine this.... we exit the 4th dimension to and enter the 5th dimension in order to travel forward or backwards at future or previous datetime

it would appear like each 4th dimensional possibility to re enter into would look like time lapse streaks and blurbs of events

if we exited out of the 5th dimension and entered into the 6th dimension to travel parallel universes that take place along side of our own known universe (where each universe has a big bang starting point the size of a 1cm^ infinitely dense and massive event)


trying to travel back to our 5th dimensional universe inside of the higher ordinal 6th dimension

every possible parllel universe would appear like a speck of light where each speck of light is actually a 5th dimensional construct 
with many many 4th dimensional possiblities inside of our universe existing inside of it)

our universe as we know it 5th dimensional with many braches of 4th dimensional possiblites 
to travel through many 4th dimensional possiblities to get back to our timeline of our known 4th dimensional time space the way we experience reality now all of our lives


think of it like this with modern space travel
when traveling 4th dimensions through space with a rocket and traveling 10 light years or really really far into space
imagine the depths of space and every single surrounding star in the depths of space............. which one............ is our star to get back to .....to get back to earth that we left from as our orign 
because every tiny speck of distant star light of trillions of stars all look and appear the same
